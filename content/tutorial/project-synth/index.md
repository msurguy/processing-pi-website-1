# Introduction:
  
Integrating low cost hardware components with Processing software paves the way for creating compelling human-computer interactions. Processing’s ease of use to create visual representations and Raspberry Pi’s established ecosystem make this combination a perfect match for education, arts and science.

The visual synthesizer (synth) project aims to introduce you to combining interactive features of Processing with access to the physical world through the input / output capacity of the Raspberry Pi and a few additional hardware components.
  
By following the steps below you will get an overall understanding of how to use Raspberry Pi and Processing together to create interactive experiences. Using this knowledge, you could create more complex interactive systems or modify your existing Processing sketches to work with synth-like hardware.

## Concepts covered:

The concepts introduced throughout this project are:

- Accessing General Purpose Input/Output pins of Raspberry Pi using official Processing GPIO library
- Circuit diagrams
- Breadboard prototypes
- Enabling interactivity with the physical world using low number of additional parts
- Analog to digital conversion
Please check out this short video of the implemented project:
