# Forum

â†³ [Processing Discourse](https://discourse.processing.org/categories)

Note the [Processing for Pi](https://discourse.processing.org/c/processing-pi) section there. For more general discussion you might find the other sections (e.g. [Coding Questions](https://discourse.processing.org/c/processing/processing-questions), [Gallery](https://discourse.processing.org/c/gallery), [Teaching](https://discourse.processing.org/c/teaching)) more fitting. Please help make our discourse a constructive and supportive forum for everyone.
